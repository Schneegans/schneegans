### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working at the University Bremen in close collaboration with the German Aersopace Center and the Bauhaus University Weimar.

In my spare time, I love creating open-source software! My current main project is ðŸ¥§ [Kando](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando), a cross-platform pie menu. In addition, I am working on three extensions for GNOME Shell: ðŸ¥§ [Fly-Pie](https://github.com/Schneegans/Fly-Pie/), ðŸ”¥ [Burn-My-Windows](https://github.com/Schneegans/Burn-My-Windows/), and the ðŸ§Š [Desktop Cube](https://github.com/Schneegans/Desktop-Cube/).

**My open-source projects are supported by these awesome people:**
